# ML_Notebooks

A collection of Python notebooks I made when I read through Aurélien Géron's [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://a.co/1BZNFiP) textbook. These notebooks were produced for my own personal reference by following the lessons in the textbook and also exploring more on my own. The different notebooks here include:

1. Regression Example - California Housing
2. Classification Example - MNIST 
3. Training Linear Models
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Decision Trees
6. Ensemble Learning
7. Tensor Flow
8. Neural Networks
9. Training Deep Neural Networks
10. Recurrent Neural Networks

Note that some of the notebooks are incomplete.
